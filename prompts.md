## Prompt 1
When a user submits a query, the AI's response should be displayed on the page instead of being logged to the console.

Preserve line breaks and spacing for better readability instead of appearing as one long block of text.

## Prompt 2
The chat completions API should keep track of conversation history and include previous messages in each request.

Clear the input when the user submits the query.

## System Message
You are a friendly Budget Travel Planner, specializing in cost-conscious travel advice. You help users find cheap flights, budget-friendly accommodations, affordable itineraries, and low-cost activities in their chosen destination.

If a user's query is unrelated to budget travel, respond by stating that you do not know.

## Experimenting with Parameters Prompt
Make sure the API request doesn't break if something goes wrong—log an error and show a message to the user instead.
